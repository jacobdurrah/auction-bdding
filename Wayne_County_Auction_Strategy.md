## Strategic Approach for Single Property Bidding

### 1. Pre-Auction Research Phase (Critical)

Since you can only bid on ONE property, thorough research is essential:

#### Property Selection Criteria
- **Avoid premium properties** (require $25,000 deposit)
- **Focus on properties with clear title potential**
- **Check demolition lists** with local building departments
- **Verify property access** (avoid landlocked parcels)
- **Research 2025 tax obligations** you'll inherit
- **Estimate total investment** including:
  - Purchase price
  - 2025 taxes (Summer and Winter)
  - Special assessments
  - Potential cleanup/renovation costs

#### Due Diligence Checklist
- [ ] Verify exact property location with assessor's office
- [ ] Check for environmental contamination risks
- [ ] Review local zoning and building codes
- [ ] Inspect property from curbside only (entering is prohibited)
- [ ] Research comparable sales in the area
- [ ] Check for existing liens not extinguished by foreclosure
- [ ] Verify property is not on demolition list

### 2. Bidding Strategy

#### A. Maximum Bid Calculation

```
Maximum Viable Bid = Property Value - All Costs - Profit Margin

Where All Costs Include:
- 2025 property taxes
- Special assessments
- Environmental assessment (if needed)
- Title insurance (if available)
- Renovation/cleanup costs
- Eviction costs (if occupied)
```

#### B. Proxy Bidding Approach

**Recommended Strategy: Use Proxy Bidding**
- Set your maximum bid as a proxy bid
- System automatically bids up to your limit
- Prevents emotional overbidding
- Allows you to "set and monitor"

#### C. Timing Considerations

**Option 1: Early Bird Strategy**
- Place proxy bid early on September 10
- Monitor throughout the auction
- Advantage: Less competition initially
- Risk: Reveals interest early

**Option 2: Sniper Strategy**
- Wait until close to batch closing time
- Place bid in final 30-60 minutes
- Advantage: Less time for counter-bidding
- Risk: Technical issues or extended bidding

**Recommended: Modified Sniper**
- Research thoroughly beforehand
- Place proxy bid 2-3 hours before batch close
- Monitor actively in final hour
- Be prepared for 5-minute extensions if bidding continues

### 3. Financial Management

#### Payment Timeline
- **Within 72 business hours**: Full payment due (if under $100,000)
- **For properties over $100,000**:
  - 25% down payment within 72 hours
  - Balance within 7 calendar days

#### Payment Methods
- Cash (in person only)
- Certified check
- Credit card (online or in person)
- ACH transfer (online)
- NO wire transfers for US residents

### 4. Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Single Property Risk
Since you can only bid on one property, consider:

1. **Have a backup plan ready** - If you're outbid, you can:
   - Submit a backup bid within 24 hours after batch closes
   - Wait for October auction (deposit carries forward)

2. **Set a hard ceiling** - Calculate maximum bid beforehand and stick to it

3. **Avoid occupied properties** - Eviction costs and delays add risk

4. **Skip properties needing major environmental cleanup** - Costs can exceed property value

5. **Focus on properties with clear, simple uses** - Residential lots or simple commercial properties

### 5. Post-Auction Actions

If you win:
1. **Immediate (within 72 hours)**:
   - Pay full purchase price
   - Pay current year taxes/assessments
   - Submit Application for Deed
   - Confirm all grantee information

2. **After deed receipt**:
   - File Property Transfer Affidavit
   - Update mailing address with local assessor
   - Arrange property insurance
   - Begin eviction proceedings if occupied

### 6. Alternative Strategy Consideration

**Consider upgrading to $10,000 deposit if:**
- You want to hedge bets across multiple properties
- You identify several good opportunities
- You want to reduce single-property risk
- October auction is also planned (can bid on more properties)

## Critical Warnings

1. **All sales are FINAL** - No refunds unless Treasurer initiates
2. **Properties sold "AS-IS, WHERE-IS"** - No warranties
3. **You're responsible for 2025 taxes** immediately
4. **Cannot enter properties** before purchase
5. **Deed delivery only after** all payments clear
6. **Title insurance may not be available**
7. **Environmental contamination** is buyer's responsibility

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Research (Now - September 9)
1. Identify 3-5 potential properties
2. Complete full due diligence on each
3. Rank by preference and viability
4. Calculate maximum bids for top choice

### Phase 2: Registration (Before September 11)
1. Complete registration on website
2. Submit $2,500 deposit + $50 fee
3. Verify deposit confirmation

### Phase 3: Bidding (September 10-18)
1. Monitor your chosen property's batch
2. Place proxy bid strategically
3. Watch for 5-minute extensions
4. Have backup bid ready if needed

### Phase 4: Post-Auction
